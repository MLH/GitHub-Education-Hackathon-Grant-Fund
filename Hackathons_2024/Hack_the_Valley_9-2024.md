# Hack the Valley 9
- October 4-6, 2024
- University of Toronto Scarborough
- Toronto, ON, Canada

Hack the Valley 9 is a premier student-run hackathon hosted at the University of Toronto Scarborough (UTSC) in Scarborough, 
Ontario, Canada. This dynamic 36-hour event took place from October 4th to October 6th, bringing together 400+ talented 
participants from universities across the globe to collaborate, innovate, and compete in a vibrant, fast-paced environment.

## Event Summary

Once again this year, Hack the Valley 9 was an incredible weekend of innovation, creativity, and connection.
This year we welcomed over 400 participants, chosen from more than 2,500 applicants across universities. They all
came together for 36 hours of intense brainstorming, coding, and problem-solving to develop innovative solutions to
real-world challenges and to compete for amazing prizes. 

Hack the Valley 9 focused on a well-distributed mix of beginner and advanced hackers this year to improve collaboration 
and learning opportunities for everyone. Additionally, we valued male to female ratio as well to support gender diversity
and inclusivity in tech. 

As in previous years, Hack the Valley proudly hosted its annual Women in Tech Summit, a flagship initiative that distinguishes 
us as the only leading Canadian hackathon to champion such a cause. Organized by our dedicated HTV team in collaboration with 
industry professionals, this summit has become a cornerstone event designed to empower women in technology. It reflects our 
commitment to fostering inclusivity and supporting underrepresented groups in the tech community. By creating a space for dialogue, 
learning, and collaboration, the Women in Tech Summit continues to inspire attendees and drive meaningful change within the industry.

This year’s summit featured a dynamic lineup of inspiring keynote speeches, thought-provoking panel discussions, and hands-on workshops 
led by influential female leaders across diverse tech sectors. Topics ranged from navigating career development and breaking barriers in 
technology to practical coding and design sessions.

## Tech Impact / Diversity 
Our event targeted first-year students (beginners) and upper-year students (3rd-4th years), creating a space where participants at different stages 
of their tech journey could collaborate and grow. This balance allowed beginners to gain valuable insights from experienced peers while providing upper-year 
students with opportunities to mentor and refine their skills. Including both groups fostered an environment of learning and innovation. By bridging these levels 
of experience, we ensured our event had a lasting impact on the tech community. This approach also encouraged a culture of mutual support and knowledge-sharing 
among hackers.

Our diversity breakdown:
- Female: 24.7%
- Male: 72.2%
- Non-binary: 0.6%

## Impact of GitHub Grant
The GitHub grant played a significant role in the success of our event by helping us to provide high-quality meals, including breakfast, lunch, and dinner, 
tailored to diverse dietary needs. This thoughtful allocation of funds ensured participants could focus entirely on their projects without worrying about 
logistical concerns. The grant also supported essential aspects of our Women in Science Summit, covering food, swag, and engaging activities. 
This summit fostered inclusivity, particularly for non-male hackers, by facilitating mentorship opportunities and creating a welcoming space for collaboration. 
With the help of the GitHub Grant, we successfully connected participants with industry leaders, strengthened their networks, and cultivated a supportive environment, 
despite the challenges of rising expenses.
