### Tell us about your hacker demographics:
 - Our target audience was students who had never attended a hackathon! After 3 years of no in person events
 we knew students around us were going to be new to the world of hacking and not know what to expect.
 We were right! We had many different team formation, introductory level workshops, and even a "How to Submit your Project" event catered
 to all of our newbies. We are so happy to be the first event they attend in the wonderful world of hacking.
- 55% male 43% female 2% Nonbinary or Other


## Impact of GitHub Grant:
- These funds allowed us to be able to book the entire gymspace, eventspace and makerspace for students to use. 
Students were able to use the tools in the maker space to build their hardware projects without worrying about being allowed within the space <br>
- We had many different students make their hardware based projects, not only using the hardware lab from MLH but also the 
MakerSpace studio we had reserved for the students to use. 

## Top Projects:

## What’s Next?
HackNYU 2023 was a success. With over 10K in prizes and 76+ projects, we couldn't have been happier with the turnout. 65% of our hackers were first time hackers, and being able to be the first experience for them is an honor.
We look forward to seeing where our hackers go a year from now, but we'll always be here to be their home base. 

HackNYU Takes place every spring between mid Feb and mid March! Be on the lookout
