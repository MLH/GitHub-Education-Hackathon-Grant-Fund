## Event Summary

- What made your hackathon special or unique? <br>
- Our Hackathon is unique as it deals with underrepresented genders in tech and to levae hackers inspired. Our main goal was to gather as many indoviduals from different fields of study as technology intersects with so many majors. It was incredibly special as being a women/ underrepresneted gender in tech is very daunting and having another women+ guide you makes you feel less alone. The community is the most important part of SheHacks+, making those connections and truly connecting with other women is really inspirational. 
- Tell us about some of the cool features, mini-events, or workshops that your organizers put on. <br>
- Some of the fun events we had at SheHacks+ 9 was stargazing at the Hume Cronyn Observatory. Other fun events was bracelet making, red bull pong, fire noodle challenge, puzzle.
- Workshops: Intro to AI, Resume building, "Tell me about yourself" workshop, OTPP, Voiceflow, Scotiabank, and Sponsor speed networking.
- How was **GitHub** featured at your event? <br>
- GitHub was featured at our event by making every project submission include their githib link to be elligible to submit. We also had a workshop based on Githib that hackers had to attend if they wanted to get the chance to win an Workshop prize.

## Impact of GitHub Grant
- How did you use the grant funds? <br>
- The funds were used for the costs of catering, venue, and merchandise. 
- How did the funds positively affect the outcomes of your event participants? <br>
- Having these funds increased the enjoyment of the event by providing delcious and high quality food to our hackers.We were able to even provide a sweet treat (bubble tea) To reward our hackers for working so hard and working to create such amazing projects. The venue cocts have increased over the last year and we were quite worried we wouldn't get the venue. The venue haqs high significance as its the venue we have used for SheHacks over the past couple of years and holds duch fond memories. We were incrdibly grateful that we were able to acquire it with the Github funds.
- We were also able to provide merch for our hackers. It was amazing to see the hackers enjoy the merch and it will be something they can caryy with them!
- (Be as detailed as possible! Being able to track the impact of these funds will go a long way in ensuring the program's longevity.)

## What’s Next?
- Include a high-level wrap-up summary <br>
- SheHacks+ 9 was an absolute blast we had an amazing time organizing and to hear how much the hackers enjoyed the food, and the mini events as well as the sponsors workshops was amazing. There were some issues we had when it came to closing ceremonies as judging took much longer than we expected even with the buffer times we added to guve us more time. Along withe some of the presentations info. Regardless, We handled it as best as we could along with our MLH rep Emily. We have lots of details on what we can do next year to make it even more memorable. We will be more prepared for issue in the upcoming shehacks and make sure all our hackers are satisfied with what we bring
- The date for SheHacks 2026 will be sometime after the wineter break. January 9 -15th, 2026 <br>
