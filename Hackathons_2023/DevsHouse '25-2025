## Impact of GitHub Grant

- Due to unexpected delays, we faced challenges in accessing the GitHub Grant funds on time. Although the funds were unavailable as anticipated, the event required financial support in key areas. Once the grant funds are received, we plan to reimburse them primarily to cover expenses which primarily boosted hacker's experiance as providing custom swags like DevsHouse keychain, notepads. Mementos and swags for judges. Some snacks and refreshments for the participating hackers and judges. We also printed GitHub standees and event banner to display our sponsors.
- These elements were essential to enhance the overall event experience and ensure its proper documentation. We had carefully planned to allocate the funds for these purposes to deliver a successful and memorable hackathon for everyone involved.
- We would like to thank GitHub doe the grants as participants enjoyed it a lot and were neve empty stomach. And stickers and swags were just cherry on the top to enhance their hacking experience.
