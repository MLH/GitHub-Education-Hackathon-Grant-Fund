# Hacktech
Hacktech is an intercollegiate hackathon hosted by the California Institute of Technology. This iteration was hosted from 4/25 to 4/27 in 2025 at Pasadena, CA, USA. 

## Event Summary

Hacktech was the first major west-coast hackathon, and this is the 11-th iteration! This was also the first fully in-person hackathon hosted by Caltech since the COVID-19 pandemic. Our hackathon featured three tracks: 
Healthcare, Sustainability, and Finance/Data Analytics. We hosted the Github Copilot workshop, held by our friends over at MLH. We also had two fantastic keynote speakers: 
- Professor Anima Anandkumar. Bren Professor of Computing at Caltech, former Senior Director of ML Research at NVIDIA, and TIME 100 Impact Award recipient. 
- Kip Thorne. Former Feynman Professor of Theoretical Physics at Caltech (until 2009), Nobel Laureatte, and consultant for the famous movies Oppenheimer and Interstellar.

Github played a major role in helping our participants collaborate in a shared codespace, and we requested that the participants share their repositories in the submission tool so that we could take a look at their work as well!

## Event Metrics 
Thie event received 2400+ applicants, from which we selected ~400 to attend our event in person. The hackathon had ~$60k worth of prizes for our participants!

## Tech Impact / Diversity 

### Tell us about your hacker demographics
Our event was targetted towards university students of all levels of experience and background. We accepted university students from all over the country. 

In total, it appears that 62.8% of our participants identify as male, 33.2% of our participants identify as female, 0.78% of our participants identified as non-binary, and the remaining 3.2% "Prefer not to say". 

### What race & ethnicities did your hackers identify as?
Unfortunately, we did not collect the this data from our participants. 

### Where were your hackers from?
Our hackers were all US university students. 

## Impact of GitHub Grant
We used grant funds to help provide prizes to the hackers - thanks to Github, we were able to partially fund the prize for the winners of the Healthcare track. 
With these funds, hackers were able to go home with prizes they're happy with. 

## Top Projects
One of the coolest projects at our event was the winner of our Best Use of AI award, Renaissance Research.

Github was used to house this project's code! This project had an amazing emphasis on scalability, a good technical implementation, and an amazing motivation. 
The impact of finding even one useful research paper during a large project is immeasurable.
