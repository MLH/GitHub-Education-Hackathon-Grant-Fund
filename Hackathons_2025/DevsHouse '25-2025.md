## Impact of GitHub Grant

- Due to unexpected delays, we faced challenges in accessing the GitHub Grant funds on time. Although the funds were unavailable as anticipated, the event required financial support in key areas. Once the grant funds are received, we plan to reimburse them primarily to cover expenses which primarily boosted hacker's experiance as providing custom swags like DevsHouse keychain, notepads. Mementos and swags for judges. Some snacks and refreshments for the participating hackers and judges. We also printed GitHub standees and event banner to display our sponsors.
- These elements were essential to enhance the overall event experience and ensure its proper documentation. We had carefully planned to allocate the funds for these purposes to deliver a successful and memorable hackathon for everyone involved.
- We would like to thank GitHub for the grants. Participants enjoyed the hackathon, hospitality, swags a lot and were never empty stomach. And stickers and swags were just cherry on the top to enhance their hacking experience.

- We also want to see how hackers used GitHub at the event. What made them special?
- Participants used GitHub to collaborate with each other on the same project. Main thing being version control which eased out everything. And also did use GitHub pages to host websites.
- We had made submission of GitHub repo mandatory as to get the whole codebase as well as to check each commit and timing of it, to ensure there is no cheating involved.
- It was really special as they came up with cutting edge technologies which impressed the judges and we got the feedback that this can even be scaled to make their own startup.
