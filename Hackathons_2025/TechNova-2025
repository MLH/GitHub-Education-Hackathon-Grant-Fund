## Impact of GitHub Grant

- How did the funds positively affect the outcomes of your event participants? <br>
- (Be as detailed as possible! Being able to track the impact of these funds will go a long way in ensuring the program's longevity.) 

How did you use the grant funds?
We want to use the GitHub grant to cover key event costs that directly enhanced the hacker experience, including venue expenses, workshop materials, accessibility services, meals/snacks, and prizes. A portion is also allocated toward swag to make attendees feel welcomed and appreciated.

How did the funds positively affect the outcomes of your event participants?

We would like to use the grant for the following items:
- Provide high-quality meals to keep participants energized and focused
- Host impactful workshops like Intro to Web/App Dev, Resume Revamp, and Mental Health panels
- Create a fun, welcoming environment with community events like karaoke, sports rallies, and boba giveaways
- Reward innovation with meaningful prizes that motivates hackers to submit high-quality projects

The grant would significantly reduce financial barriers and help us plan a more inclusive, engaging, and professional experience for our hackers. Many participants mention this is their first hackathon ever, and that the supportive environment gives them the confidence to keep exploring tech.
