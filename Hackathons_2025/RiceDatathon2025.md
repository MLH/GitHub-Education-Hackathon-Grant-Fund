## Impact of GitHub Grant
The GitHub grant was a pivotal resource in making **Rice Datathon 2025** an unforgettable experience for all participants. The funds were primarily allocated to three key areas:

## 1. Food and Beverages
- **Provide catering** for meals throughout the event, including breakfast, lunch, and dinner, to ensure participants stayed fueled.
- **Late-night snacks** like pizza and sandwiches helped sustain energy levels during the hackathon's crunch time.
- **Hydration stations** with drinks and snacks kept hackers refreshed and ready to keep coding all night.

## 2. Swag and Prizes
GitHub‚Äôs generous support enabled us to offer quality swag and prizes that both motivated and delighted participants:
- **Custom GitHub-branded merch**, including t-shirts and stickers, was given out to all participants, reinforcing the connection between GitHub and the event.
- **Prize pool** for top projects included headphones, Amazon gift cards, and other tech goodies, which helped create a competitive yet fun atmosphere.

## 3. Inclusivity and Participant Support
The grant funds were also used to make the event more accessible and inclusive:
- **Parking vouchers** for students from underrepresented groups and smaller schools within Texas, helping reduce barriers to participation.

## Positive Impact on Participants
The GitHub grant‚Äôs investment into food, swag, and inclusivity directly impacted the experience and outcomes of our hackers:
- **Enhanced participant experience**: Hackers felt well-supported, energized, and motivated to push their ideas to the limit, knowing they had everything they needed to focus on their projects.
- **Increased diversity and inclusivity**: By reducing financial barriers and supporting travel for underrepresented groups, the event fostered a more diverse and welcoming community.
- **Engaged and inspired hackers**: The high-quality swag and prizes incentivized hackers to go above and beyond in creating their projects, contributing to the overall success and quality of submissions.

## Tracking Long-Term Impact
We‚Äôre confident that the positive experience provided by these resources will have lasting effects:
- **Increased retention**: Many participants mentioned they would return for future hackathons, and several expressed interest in further collaborations within the Rice Data Science Club.
- **Building connections with GitHub**: GitHub‚Äôs involvement not only provided support for this event but also introduced participants to version control best practices and the GitHub ecosystem, which will benefit their future projects.
