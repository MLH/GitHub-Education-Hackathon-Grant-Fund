# DUWiT Hacks 1 
 - **March 1st - 2nd 2025** 
 - **Durham University Women in Tech (Durham University)**
 - **Durham, England**  

## Event Summary

- DUWiT Hacks 2025 was an inaugural diversity-focused hackathon, being run for the first time ever to create a welcoming space where women, non-binary individuals and other underrepresented groups in tech could feel empowered and uplifted. Not only was this event brigning together these members from Durham University, but from all across the North East of England, with an aim of building a cross-university network across all universities such as Newcastle, Northumbria, Sunderland, and Teeside. 
DUWiT Hacks was special because it provided that first stepping stool to helping build that society and foster that community spirit that will, hopefully, grow into a strong and tight-knit network. 

- As an event surrounding a theme of community and a welcoming space for all, we had some really unique mini events: <br>
    - Yoga/ Breathwork with one of our sponsors - RTC
    - Bracelet making/ swapping in the evening
    - The best attended mini-event was the Tech Together event, where participants attended and shared and bonded over stories about struggles they've faced joining the tech community. 
    
These were great ways of making the hackathon component of the event feel less intimidating, and it was evident that 


- How was **GitHub** featured at your event? <br> 
GitHub was encouraged to be used as the platform for version control for each team's projects. Many of our hackers were complete beginners and had never been to a hackathon before, so coding up an entirely new project felt intimidating to them. The use of an easy version control platform where participants were easily able to push their work and collaborate and see their project expanding was encouraging, and helped to de-mystify the typically scary concept of version control and software management.

## Tech Impact / Diversity 

### Tell us about your hacker demographics
The target audiences for our event were women, non-binary individuals, and other underrerpesetned groups in tech. What we'd found in the past was that, despite attending diversity focused events, whilst attendees would of course all be allies, the split in diversity across attendees still primary had women, non-binary individuals and other underrepresented groups in the minority. This is why we decided to make a space exclusively dedicated to this audience. 

100% of our hackers identified as female, non-binary, or demigirl. 

### What race & ethnicities did your hackers identify as?

## Impact of GitHub Grant
-
The grant funds were entirely used to cover catering costs. We had sandwiches, burritos, midnight donuts, pastries, more sandwiches, and a plethora of snacks. 

- This food was what kept fueling hackers throughout the event and had we not had the funding, the quality of food we would have been able to provide would have been much poorer, and our hackers deserve the best possible food (and not just junk food!) we can get them. 
It also meant hackers didn't have to leave the venue to get external snacks, or go home to cook a proper meal, so the hackathon spirit was able to stay alive throughout the event. 

## Top Projects

- The theme of our hackathon was launch, so we wanted to see hackers take their small ideas and launch them into bigger ones. A lot of our hackers took this on directly and implemented space themed projects, incorporating creative ways to get the theme into their project. 
- A particularly lovely project was "Beam Me Up", made by hackers who are all either international students or who have family who live far away. This core theme united the team and they built a mental health tracking app, but still incorporated the theme of launch by making it space themed. 

- This group used GitHub to manage their project and collaborate on different aspects of their project. They used the branching quality to work on different features of their projects, including adding a dashboard, and testing the UI design of their final project. 
- 
This project was particularly cool because it was rooted in their own experiences, which means the impact of a project like theirs would go very far. They had also considered diversity and inclusion, and from the get go, implemented a personalisable mascot so users would be able to build characters that reflected themselves. 
It was very much a user driven project, built for international students, by international students.

## Whatâ€™s Next?

DUWiT Hacks will be an annual event, so what we'll hopefully see is the community expand, and more people from other universities attending. The dates for the next event are unconfirmed right now, but will likely be in February or March of 2026.
