# SproutHacks
 - **February 28 - March 2, 2025** 
 - **SproutHacks**
 - **Canada, Ontario, Waterloo**  

## Event Summary

- We are a first-iteration beginner-focused high-school only hackathon. We welcomed high school students from dozens of schools all around the province. <br>
- With a focus on eco-friendliness, our event included a best environmental hack prize track, and we invited Green Party MP Mike Morrice as a guest speaker. <br>
- Other guest speakers incude Jerry Zhu (Data @ super.com), Brian Zhang (SWE @ x.com), and Mike Janzen (Waterloo-based investor and philanthropist). <br>
- Our hackathon included many fun activities, including a sponsored Minecraft tournament and a Brawl Stars tournament. <br>
- Github was used as a source control software by all participants. It especially came in handy when one team built their whole project using AI :( and then accused another team of doing the same :( <br>
- *We’d love to see pictures if you have them!* <br>

## Impact of GitHub Grant
- Grant funds were instrumental in purchasing food, swag and insurance for our event. We were able to utilize the funds to purchase better meals and more food overall for our hackers, which was very important and helped make us more flexible, helping us cater to hackers' needs during the first weekend of Ramadan. The funds will also aid us in increasing our flexibility in purchasing and shipping our prizes due to tariffs. <br>
- We were able to provide high quality food and cater to all participants' restrictions, including those that accidentally weren't disclosed during signup. We also provided swag, tshirts, snacks, and a great prize pool. <br>

## Top Projects

- [Therapy with LeBron](https://devpost.com/software/therapy-with-lebron): the greatest hackathon project to ever be completed <br>

## What’s Next?
- SproutHacks 2025 was a first-iteration 36 hour high school hackathon by high school students, held in person at Conestoga College's Waterloo Campus. We brought together almost 80 hackers, including almost 50% first time hackers, to learn, build and have a phenomenal weekend. For our next iteration, we will learn from our shortfalls this year, particularly in the marketing and finance departments, and strive carry over the many phenomenal partnerships we made for this iteration, with organizations such as MLH and Hack Club, with sponsors, and with vendors such as Dominos Pizza. We'll also gain more flexibility in our planning process, as Conestoga is offering to move us to their brand new state of the art esports arena, allowing us to hold our event whenever we need to (probably not the first week of Ramadan), and to increase our capacity for hackers and for activties. Overall, the planning process for the first ever SproutHacks was not without its roadblocks, but with the help of sheer willpower, our MLH rep Kevin, MLH Coach Christine, and the GitHub + MLH Grant, we were able to make it a life-changing event for 75 high school students (and over a dozen high school organizers). <br>
