## Event Summary

- We are a first-iteration beginner-focused high-school only hackathon. We welcomed high school students from dozens of schools all around the province. <br>
- With a focus on eco-friendliness, our event included a best environmental hack prize track, and we invited Green Party MP Mike Morrice as a guest speaker. <br>
- Other guest speakers incude Jerry Zhu (Data @ super.com), Brian Zhang (SWE @ x.com), and Mike Janzen (Waterloo-based investor and philanthropist). <br>
- Our hackathon included many fun activities, including a sponsored Minecraft tournament and a Brawl Stars tournament. <br>
- Github was used as a source control software by all participants. It especially came in handy when one team built their whole project using AI :( and then accused another team of doing the same :( <br>
- *We’d love to see pictures if you have them!* <br>

## Impact of GitHub Grant
- Grant funds were instrumental in purchasing food, swag and insurance for our event. We were able to utilize the funds to purchase better meals and more food overall for our hackers, which was very important and helped make us more flexible, helping us cater to hackers' needs during the first weekend of Ramadan. The funds will also aid us in increasing our flexibility in purchasing and shipping our prizes due to tariffs. <br>
- How did the funds positively affect the outcomes of your event participants? <br>
