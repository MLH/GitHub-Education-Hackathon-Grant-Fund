## Event Summary

We hosted a critical thinking workshop at the beginning of our event to help our hackers brainstorm in the context of our mission! We taught hackers how to use Github and hackers also used Github Copilot!

## Tech Impact / Diversity 

### Tell us about your hacker demographics
QWER Hacks @ UCLA is Major League Hacking's first collegiate LGBTQIA+ hackathon that celebrates the queer and trans community in STEM. We bring together queer individuals and allies through tech talks, technical and community-building workshops, and development of innovative projects to help underrepresented groups! Most of our hackers identify as part of the LGBTQIA+ community, non-binary, female, and other gender expansive identities.

### What race & ethnicities did your hackers identify as?
| Native American / <br> Alaskan Native | Black / <br> African American | Hispanic / <br> Latinx | Asian | White |

## Impact of GitHub Grant
The Github Grant funds made it possible for us to support the travel grants of LGBTQIA+ students who reside outside of Los Angeles! This was very important to us because hackathons like ours that specifically foster an inclusive space for LGBTQIA+ students do not exist elsewhere. We also used these funds to purchase necessary supplies and food. Our ability to provide travel stipends is directly tied to our mission of connecting queer students in tech! Our hackathon was enriched by the interaction of students across the country whereas past iterations have mostly only been students from our university. Travel grantees and attendees said it was their most meaningful hackathon experience becuase they felt supported and validated as LGBTQ+ students in tech.

## Top Projects

One of our teams build a hardware hack that uses compliant wheels to navigate different terrains for accessibility! Another project created a type font to protect authors from AI copyright enfrigement while keeping the text accessible. Hackers used Github to collaborate on their projects and many used Github Copilot!

## Whatâ€™s Next?
Overall, QWER Hacks 2025 was a success! We were able to support hackers through our mission of helping LGTBQIA+ students in tech find community and learn about intersectional, interdisciplinary ways of making positive social impact using their technical skills. We are super excited to host QWER Hacks 2026 next year in late January/early February!
