## Impact of GitHub Grant
- How did you use the grant funds? <br>
  The GitHub grant was used to help buy food for our hackers!
  
- How did the funds positively affect the outcomes of your event participants? <br>
  We wanted to make sure that our hackers were well fed and fueled to finish up their projects, so the grant definitely helped us in achieving this goal.
  We specifically used it for lunch on Saturday, which was our most expensive meal. The hackathon started on Friday night and ended Sunday afternoon, so Saturday was the only full day that we had.
  Because of this, we made sure that we had as much food as possible for the hackers on Saturday, and having the money from the GitHub grant ensured that we were able to provide them 3 filling meals.

## Top Projects

- What were some of the coolest projects at your event? <br>
  One of the coolest projects was called "Plan Your Care"! It won the Best Overall and the Best Use of MongoDB Atlas Prizes. The project showed a map of the US and provided abortion law information
  for each state as well as the nearest abortion clinic. The website also had a chatbot that would answer questions. Another interesting feature of the project is that it encrypts the information of
  users that access the website so that other people cannot trace that they accessed the website.
  
- We also want to see how hackers used GitHub at the event <br>
  All hackers had to submit a link to their project's GitHub repo onto Devpost.

## What’s Next?
- We are planning to host WiNGHacks again in 2026! WiNGHacks is dedicated to increasing the number of underrepresented people in tech, and the GitHub Education Grant has been incredibly helpful
  these past two years in helping us to achieve our goal. We are hoping to increase the number of hackers for next year, with planning for next year's hackathon already in full swing!
  
- What are the dates for your future hackathon? <br>
  WiNGHacks will be taking place again in Spring 2026, with the exact dates being released later.
