# GrizzHacks 7
Oakland Unversity's 7th annual Hackathon, GrizzHacks 7, held on March 22-23rd, 2024. Held in Rochester Hills, Michigan

## Event Summary
After a successful reboot last year, we built on the momentum we started last year to grow this event!

- Our Hackathon was special because it's for a small, commuter University. It was very difficult even bringing awareness to our students that an event like this even exists. It took a small team of ours a lot of outreach and a ton of effort to raise further awareness.
- Having a few people as second time organizers now, we were able to exapand on activites and do higher quality outreach / marketing all while maintaining the level of success at the event itself.
- Github was featured in the sponsorship materials, on our shirts, and in every single project that was uploaded to devpost

## Impact of GitHub Grant
- We used the funds provided from the Github grant to provide incluive nutriitonal food every single one of our participants. We had a lot of hackers who were Vegan or Halal we had to account for and the Github grant made it much easier to do so.
- We were able to provide a much better experience during meals, and were even able to provide one off meal vouchers for students who could not eat what we provided. 

## Top Projects
- We had a ton of amazing projects, I was blown away by the throughfulness of the ideas and ingenuity of the students to pull them off 
- The top project form our event was called iCare - an AI powered system to intergrate realtime health monitoring with smart whellchair navigation all in a single app. This consisted of both a hardware and software component.
- We made sure every single hacker had a github repo attached to their project submission so it could be judged.
- [DevPost proejct gallery](https://grizzhacks7.devpost.com/project-gallery).. Each project was special in it's own way and it was amazing to see how the personailty of each group that we got to know well over the 24 hours was shown off in their project idea.

## Whatâ€™s Next?
- We are coming back stronger for GrizzHacks 8. We managed to raise a ton of money nearing our event date and will have the means of growing a ton this next year!
- We are thinking of doing around the same time. Early March made a lot of sense with all school schedules.
