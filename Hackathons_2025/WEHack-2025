## Event Summary

- What made your hackathon special or unique? <br> 
WEHack is a hackathon that focuses on empowering women, non-binary, and other underrepresented groups in STEM! The organization aims to encourage more 
underrepresented individuals to harness their skills by creating software or hardware projects through hackathons. WEHack is open to all majors, universities, 
and experience levels!
- Tell us about some of the cool features, mini-events, or workshops that your organizers put on. <br> 
For WEHack 2025, our organizers worked on bringing a new feature to each aspect of the hackathon. The WEHack Marketing team created a testimonial video and recap video
to present to hackers during the closing ceremony. The WEHack Development team utilized a new system called HackKit (from the UTSA RowdyHacks team) for the website this year.
The WEHack Industry team provided nine sponsors to hackers at WEHack, which is the highest number of sponsors achieved by WEHack thus far. The WEHack Experience team
provided interesting workshops to hackers throughout the hackathon with the help of student organizations and sponsors. The Experience team also incentivized workshops
with a scavenger hunt for hackers, giving them the opportunity to win a film camera at the end! The WEHack Logistics team provided signature WEHack merchanise to hackers,
along with tasty meals and drinks like Poppi and Alani Nu.
- How was **GitHub** featured at your event? <br> 
We used GitHub as the main platform for hackers to collaborate with each other when developing their projects. For project submissions, a link to the GitHub repository
was required for the WEHack General Track and the three sponsor challenges.

## Impact of GitHub Grant
- How did you use the grant funds? <br>
We utilized the grant funds to purchase snacks, drinks, decorations, and other essential supplies for the hackathon.
- How did the funds positively affect the outcomes of your event participants? <br>
- (Be as detailed as possible! Being able to track the impact of these funds will go a long way in ensuring the program's longevity.) 
We were able to create a welcoming and positive environment that visibly represents WEHack for hackers. With the GitHub Education
Grant, we were able to purchase snacks and drinks that ensure the comfortability of hackers as they work for 24 hours. We handed the snacks and drinks to hackers
during snack passout on Saturday, Midnight Snack on Sunday, and the Judging Expo on Sunday. We were also able to use the funds to purchase decorations that 
followed our theme this year, "Timeless Moments Await". Some of our decorations included lights, our famous WEHack balloon arch, and butcher paper
for the walls of the building where the hackathon was taking place. With the purchased paper, we created skylines to place on the walls and a giant film strip where hackers could write
their favorite quote. The balloon arch is an old tradition of WEHack because it has been hung in the building every year since WEHack 2022. The GitHub Education Grant 
played a crucial role in providing a better experience for our hackers and in creating a retro aesthetic of WEHack for the hackathon. 

## Top Projects

- What were some of the coolest projects at your event? <br> 
One of the coolest projects at WEHack was called "Lane Bot" which won the 1st place prize for the WEHack General challenge! This team worked on making the roads safer 
by adding intelligent lane detection and assistance on classic vehicles. This project is special because of its compatibility with older vehicles.
Another cool project was called "Trip Down Melody Lane", which won the 2nd place prize for the WEHack General challenge! The project focuses on connecting music and
photos together with the use of the Spotify API. The application presents songs that the user listened to and the photos taken on a certain day in Google Photos. 
One of the other coolest projects was called "Memory Lane" which won the 3rd place prize for the WEHack General challenge! The project aims to connect users with hidden gems 
in their community using geolocations. The application highlights vintage landmarks like arcades, coffee shops, and art boutiques.
